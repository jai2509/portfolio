      <h3>CarGO</h3>
    <p> This website is made by me and my team for google solution challenge 2023 .First, we have an AQI calculator that can help you understand the air quality in your area and how it affects your health. By entering your location and some basic information, the calculator will provide you with a real-time air quality index, which can help you make informed decisions about your activities and the precautions you need to take to protect your health.
      Next, we have an ACH calculator that can help you understand the amount of fresh air that is being circulated through your home or building. By providing information on how to improve indoor air quality, such as increasing ventilation or using air purifiers, the calculator can help reduce exposure to harmful pollutants and improve health outcomes.
      We also have a carbon emission calculator that can help you understand the carbon footprint of your daily activities, such as transportation, food consumption, and energy use. By providing this information, you can identify areas where you can reduce your carbon footprint, such as by taking public transportation, eating a plant-based diet, and using renewable energy sources.
      Finally, we have a calculator that calculates the carbon consumption by a human body, which can help you understand the environmental impact of your food choices. By providing information on the carbon footprint of different foods, the calculator can encourage you to make more sustainable choices, such as choosing plant-based foods or foods that are locally sourced and in season.
      To develop this website, I used HTML and CSS for the design, and JavaScript and React.js to make it responsive. For the backend, I used Node.js with the Express framework to create an API for data processing and storage. Additionally, I integrated Google Cloud Maps API and several other APIs to provide accurate and up-to-date information.
      But the impact of this website can extend beyond individual actions. By providing access to the backend database, the government can use the data collected by the website to inform policy decisions and reduce pollution at a larger scale. For example, the carbon emission calculator can help the government identify the most significant sources of greenhouse gas emissions and develop policies to reduce them, such as incentives for electric vehicle adoption or increased investment in renewable energy. The AQI and ACH calculators can help the government identify areas where air quality is poor and develop strategies to improve it, such as improving public transportation or increasing green spaces in urban areas.
      Overall, I hope that this website can help individuals take action to combat climate change and provide valuable data to the government to inform policy decisions and reduce pollution at a larger scale.
